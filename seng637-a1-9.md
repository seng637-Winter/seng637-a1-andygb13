# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

In the process of testing a program that simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), a comparison between exploratory testing and manual functional testing reveals distinct strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Exploratory testing stands out for its flexibility and adaptability, making it highly effective for simulating real-world user behaviors and uncovering unexpected bugs. However, its lack of structure can lead to oversight of important scenarios, and issues discovered might be challenging to reproduce. On the other hand, manual functional testing, particularly when utilizing a predefined test suite, ensures comprehensive coverage of all specified ATM functionalities. This method excels in consistency and reproducibility of results. Despite this, its scope is limited to pre-planned scenarios, potentially missing out on unforeseen issues, and can be quite time-consuming. Ultimately, combining the creativity and adaptability of exploratory testing with the thoroughness and reliability of manual functional testing forms a more holistic approach, leading to robust and reliable ATM software. This balanced methodology ensures not only that each defined function is rigorously tested, but also that there is room for uncovering and addressing unexpected real-world scenarios.
